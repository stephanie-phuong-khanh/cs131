When tested on a 4 by 4 square puzzle, the tower implmentation
without finite domain solver was (averaged across 20 trials)
6.175x slower than plain tower which did not use finite domain
solver, although the code for plain tower appears to be cleaner.

Using the ambiguous/4 predicate with N=4, I found the ambiguous puzzle:
    C = counts([4,2,2,1],[1,2,2,4],[4,2,2,1],[1,2,2,4])
    T1 = [[1,2,3,4],[2,1,4,3],[3,4,1,2],[4,3,2,1]]
    T2 = [[1,2,3,4],[2,4,1,3],[3,1,4,2],[4,3,2,1]]
